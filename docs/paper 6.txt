Introduction
Due to the large amount of formulaic constructions found in the language which may need to be mastered in addition to the languages� syntax, acquiring those formulas are proof of mastering the language. Along with collocational preferences, formulaicity is rather hard to acquire by L2 learners. By finding the traces of formulaicity in teaching, this paper seeks to find whether or not the classroom materials and instructions focus on improving students� efficiency in the language via formulas in production and acquisition. The author has chosen three key stages in which formulaicity should be attested, which are: input, intake, and post output. Through these stages, he aims to study the education intervention of the teachers, and the materials. 
Type of Input presented to learners
	In the classroom settings, authentic documents, textbooks, and the teacher-talk are supposedly key sources of natural native inputs. Due to the large amount of talking of teachers, they are one of the key sources of native like input. Textbooks created for the classes are also one of the mostly used source of input. 
Textbooks 
	Textbooks are considered as one of the key material containing inputs from the target language. However, these materials have shown many discrepancies to include words and phrases that are hardly used and lacking of ubiquitous words and phrasal construction used in the target language in addition to the lacking of differences between spoken and written syntax and  pragmatics. Corpus based textbooks should in part focus on formulaic language, as it would contain the spoken language as it is used. However, there is a limited amount of devotion to formulaicity, as well as a lack of consensus between different books of the same level. Though corpus linguistics may be able to help improve the contents of the textbooks, it is hard to determine the amount of �native like� formulas in the book, and books are slow in exploiting corpora due to lacking of access.
Teacher-Talk
	 Due to the large volume of TTT, teachers are represented as one of the most important key sources of �native-like� input in SLA.  From this, one may infer that the teachers themselves are native, and therefore, can reproduce native formulaic language, which is not the case. Therefore, TTT is not necessarily one of the key sources of formulaic language. Teachers may use a large amount of vocabularies; however, students may not acquire them because of the lack of their usage frequency. In addition, teachers are reluctant in using native formulaic language, or authentic materials due to the large amount of variations found in the spoken language. The latter may prove to be rather difficult to teach students. Though it would be helpful in increasing the student�s fluency, because the teachers did not receive it, they also refrain from teaching it (given that they have mastered it themselves). 
Classroom Task
	Classroom task, as part of the intake and interaction of learning the language, plays an important role in improving the students� fluency. From these tasks, activation tasks, which emphasize on oral exercises help the students focus on the meaning, rather than the syntax, or other part of the language, they can implicitly use those, as would a native learning his own language. However, these task can be merely rehearsal task testing memories rather than task improving their fluency in formulaic constructions. 
Enabling skills and language exercises
	Enabling skills and language exercises are tasks related to the mastery of the language in which the students are enable to use, and practice through communication. Of the many ways of findings examples of the intended speech patterns are through corpora. 
Teaching methodology, itself, supports the use of corpora as it is a key source of examples for phrasal structures, patterns, and collocations. However, real teaching does not (often) permits its application. This process is time consuming, and require substantial supports. And though it may be helpful to some, it may also be [useless] to others, therefore, it is not favored.  
Corpus consultation can be done in class to promote the usage of corpora in the curriculum. Dictionary consultations of words that are not common may even be helpful to students.  However, teaching the students how to consult these materials, specially, the corpora may be challenging. Especially if the teachers themselves are not well trained. In addition, the lack of proper environment, influences, motivations, and awareness, the learners would not be able to use them, nor see the need.
Communication activities
	Communicative activities are activities in which the learners practice what they have learned, may it be by section, or subsection, but on a limited focus. Through that, the students are to focus on what they are saying, and not the how. 
	This activity can also be influenced and improve by corpus usage. By familiarizing themselves with the collocational preferences within a language, through the usage of NLP, the learners can compare their production with that provided by the corpora. 
Feedback 
	Self-feedback usage by learners through the use of computers have proven to be rather a more productive means of acquiring certain aspect of the language. Using concordance tools with monolingual corpora can help students to be able to correct themselves without the feedback of a teacher. Additionally, if the teacher has yet to master the formulaicity of a language, this process can be useful as well. 
Concluding remarks
	Our improving understanding of the formulaicity of the language is impacting L2 teachings. Despite the continuous need of authentic usage of the language in the classroom, there is a lack of material using formulaic language available to the L2 learners. Formulaic language can support all aspect in the teaching methodology, and teaching methodology highly support the usage of authentic materials. However, there is still the part of actually providing these authentic usage, which can be solved through the usage of the corpora. 
Thoughts
The teachers are spoken of as if they have mastered the usage of the target formulaic language. This may be true, however, this remains to be proven. Because most L2 teachers are non-native, they may find more difficulty in mastering the formulaic language. Here in the US, the L2 taught in classrooms are more focused on a �standard� (closer to the written, than the spoken) language, rather communicational fluency. Therefore, the teachers are prone to refrain from the authentic materials that are less than accepted as �standard�.
In teaching, there is no particular material, nor methodology that can work for every single students. Therefore, though the popularity of certain method may be lacking due to its strenuouity, its beneficence to some, and not others should not play a part in its implementation. 
The usage of dictionaries to help understand terminology, and to learn the way which a certain term is used is very helpful. Though it may be helpful, it may also decrease the need for a learner to remember what it means because by checking the dictionary for the translation of the word, the student is not production anything but learning. Though the dictionary may contain usage of the word in the intended language. However, using monolingual dictionary would be uselful not only in helping the learner finding the definition, seeing how is it used, but it will also improve the learner�s vocabulary. In order to understand a word, the learner would need to understand the words used to describe the word as well, along with its collocation. Therefore, the student is acquiring more than intentionally wanted.
