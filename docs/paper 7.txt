Chapter I
Introduction
Over the last sixty years, Haitian Creole has seen much advancement in its linguistics studies, including, but not limited to, morphology (Sylvain 1936; Degraff 2001), sociolinguistic variation (Hypolite 1949, 1985; Valdman 1975; Dejean 1980a-c, Haza�l-Massieux 2005), phonetic and phonology (F�r�re 1974; Dejean 1980a), and orthography (Hall 1951; Churchill 1957; Pompilus 1973; Dejean 1980; Scheiffelin & Rachelle 1998). Having seen its origin from the end of the XVII century (Haza�l-Massieux 2005) through the amalgamation of French, African languages, and the indigenous language of the country (Valdman 1975:175), Haitian Creole is neither a new, nor an ancient language. However, being no more than 200 years old, the linguistics studies of the language seen thus far are but mere starting points for further studies. Though the language has seen many studies from these areas, there is however a lack of research from the influential effect of one linguistic structure to another.
Purpose of study
Haitian Creole�s orthography is a near phonemic representation of the spoken language (Dejean 1980a: 83); therefore, there is a direct correlation between the language�s orthography and its phonology. This correlation can facilitate writing, enunciating, reading, teaching as well as transcribing the language. However, because this �graphy� is written based on the pronunciation, it may lead to multiple variations of word spellings in the written language. Through the study of the pronouns, this paper seeks to answer the question of if the phonological variations attested in the spoken language influence the orthography of the language. . 
This paper is divided into four chapters. The first one introduces the paper, its purpose, as well as its format. The second chapter provides an article review of studies conducted thus far in the field phonetic and phonology along with orthography. It also provides some background information on the orthography of the language. The third chapter presents a more concise description of the goal of the paper, along with the methodology of the study. The fourth chapter presents the finding of the study in conjunction with the conclusion inferred from the analysis. It also presents a discussion of further studies to be conducted to shine more light on the inner structural influences in the language. 
Chapter II
Phonetic and phonology of Haitian Creole
Scholars believe that the language saw its origin in the late XVII century through the European colonization (Haza�l-Massieux 2005: 39) in addition to the influence of the French language of the settlers and the West African languages brought by the slaves; yet, Haitian Creole can be traced back to the first inhabitants of the country, the Tainos Indians (Bonenfant 2011:28). Haitian Creole is an amalgamation of languages. It contains French, from which it acquires most of its terminology, as well as Arawak of the indigenous, and Spanish from the first settlers of the land. I acquires some terminology for English as well due to the contact during the American Occupation from 1914 to 1915. These terminologies along with the syntax of the West African language spoken by the slaves make up the Haitian Creole language. In addition to the terminology and the syntax, each of these languages stated had phonological influences on Haitian Creole. Due to these influences, multiple variation of the language are attested throughout the country. However, they are not significantly different from one another.
Based on these influences, three diatopic variations have been attested: the North, the South and the center (Bonenfant 2011: 28). The latter shows the most difference from the previous ones due to its high frequency of contact with other languages, e.g., French, Spanish, and English. This variation contains many phonemes, such as the front round vowels, that are not attested as frequently in the North, nor in the South (Dejean 1980). Additionally, because the schools are thought in French, the educated members of the country speak a �decreolized� variation of the language (Valdman 1991), which contains not only words with French phonological influences, but also French words, instead of Haitian Creole words. 
In order to choose a standard for the Haitian Creole language, the variation found in the center was adopted; however, it was purged from any phonological influences from other languages (Villeneuve, Seigel, & Valdman 2013: 1). And since the orthography is a near phonemic representation of the language, i.e., the Standard Spoken Language, it should also contain minimal influences from French, Spanish, or English.  
Orthography of the Haitian Creole
The official standardized orthography of the language contains thirty-two phonemic symbols representing the phonemic sounds attested in the Standard Haitian Creole. These symbols, made up of letters, or a combination thereof, are referred to as the alphabets or letters of the alphabets of Haitian Creole.

Table 1. Pressoir�s 1968 Haitian Creole Alphabets 
As presented in Table 1 above, each letter of the Haitian Creole Alphabet has a direct correlation to an IPA symbol. These letters are further separated into vowels: a, an, e, �, en, o, �, on, ou, ui; semi-vowels: w, y, and the remaining letters make up the consonants of the language (Note that � is the same as a, /a/ but only used to differentiate between an /?~/ and �n /an/). Due to the limited amount of phonemes used in the language, having an orthography that represents its phonology simplifies the process in which one reads, writes, speaks and learns the language  .
In English, a word containing the same set of letters may be attested with a different set of phonemes. As found in Tagliamonte (2012)�s Variationist Sociolinguistics, tomato can be attested with either an [e] or an [a:] sound for the mid-syllable, or in the case of neither, the first syllable can be enunciated with either [i], or [aj] (177). Similarly, in French, a letter of the alphabet may represent different sounds depending on its environment; as shown by Antes (2006), e from the alphabet may be attested as [?] in �les�, [e] in �aimer�, and [�] or not attested at all in �venue� (53). In addition, multiple different letters of the alphabet may combine to create a phoneme; therefore, the same sound may be represented in different combination of letters (B�chade 1992). Contrarily to these languages, the [letters] of the alphabet correlates directly to a phoneme. Consequently, every lexeme can be pronounced, based on the knowledge of the alphabets, and can be written based on its pronunciation. 
Haitian Creole orthography saw many changes since the first attempt was made by McConnell in the 1940�s (Dejean 1980:19). From these changes, we saw a shrink in the number of letters. The consonants remained relatively the same throughout those changes, except for the letters c, k and q of the French language which are reduced k to represent the phone /k/. In addition, ng [?] was removed and left to be represented by two phones /n/ and /g/. Beside this consonant, the main problems arrived in representing the nasal vowels, the round vowels, and the semi-vowels.   
Using the French language, the closest language to Haitian Creole, as well as the main source of its terminologies (Valdman 1975:174), McConnel introduced the French representation of the nasal vowels an, in, and on to represent the phonemes /�/, /?~/ and /�/ respectively (Dejean 1980:22). He also introduced representations for the front round vowels, which were later dismissed. There were over twenty different propositions for the representation of the language between 1940, and the adoption of Pressoir�s proposition for the orthography in 1968. The latter is now used as the official orthography of the language (168). Given that the orthography is based on the pronunciation of the lexemes, if a lexeme is attested differently phonologically, due to either diotopic variation or contact, it risks having more than one way of being spelled. 
Phonetic variatonal studies
Since �Phonological variables are straightforward, in the sense that they are obvious functional equivalents� (Tagliamonte 2012:177), they may also be easily attested. Phonological variation is one of the well-studied area of sociolinguistic variation, possibly due to its high sensitivity to social and geographical influences (177). Within the phonological variations, Tagliamonte (2012) has studied the omission of the alveolar plosive /t/ and /d/, along with the lexeme ending (ing), at word final positions, Beeby & Scheiman (1999) studied the variations of /d�t/, don�t based on its collocational frequency in addition to Labov, who has covered multiple different aspect of phonological variations within the English language. In French, we have Thomas (2002) who studied the attestation of the schwa and the liquid /l/ in graduate students� speech patterns. 
Similarly, Haitian Creole has seen many variational studies. Amongst the well-documented studies, we have the use of the front round vowels /y/, /� / and /�/ in the urban area, versus the counterpart front vowels /i/, /e/, and /?/ in the rural area, along with the attestation of the postvocalic /?/in speech pattern found in the urban area of Port-au-Prince due to contact with French (Valdman 1975). Hyppolite (1949) and Valdman (1984, 1988), have conducted multiple studied diatopical phonological variations in the Haitian Creole language. In addition to the geographical variations, Fattier-Thomas (1984) also differentiates between the educated variations and the rural variations. One of the latest studies conducted in Haitian Creole is the Morphophonological Variation in Haitian Creole: the Case of 3SG, by Villeneuve, Seigel, & Valdman, in which they compare the variation of the 3rd person singular li / l� of the Standard Haitian Creole verses i/y of the Cap Haitain Creole. 
Though not all of these variables may be attested in the writing of the language, such as the high round vowels, or the post-vocalic /?/, since they were removed from the official orthography of the language, other variables such as i for li could be accepted in written text. In his study of the history, and development of the French language on a phonological, morphological, semantic, and syntactic level, Lodge (1993) also presents the orthographical changes that occurred throughout these centuries. His study also shows a clear correlation between the spoken language, and the written language. Though the written language was heavily influenced by the academia in the 16th century, orthography changed along with the spoken language, as it was a representation of the spoken language.  
Though French is more phonologically and orthographically complex that Haitian Creole, this study seeks to find whether, and how these phonological variations studied influence the orthography of the language by analyzing how the spoken variants occur in written text.

Table 2. Pronouns of Haitian Creole.
Haitian Creole contains five sets of pronouns, each of which contains at least two variants as shown in Table 2 above. These pronouns are used as subject (1), object (2), as well as to show possession (3), and emphasis (4).
(1)	Yo  kite moun yo antre lib. - They let the people enter freely
(2)	Sa kapab menm voye  ou  nan peyi san chapo. - This can even kill you.
(3)	Nou menm tou, se pou nou ch�che kenbe t�  nou  ak pyebwa ak z�b.  - Us too, we have to try to keep our soil with trees and with grass.
(4)	Mwen  menm, mwen pa kite yon s�l ti pye raje sou lakou a. - Me, I don�t leave not even one weed branch on the backyard
In certain languages, such as French, or English, different forms of pronouns are used in different syntactical positions e.g., I, me, and my in English, or Je, moi, and mon/ma are used as subject, object, and to show possessions, respectively. Contrastively, in Haitian Creole, the same forms are used in all of these positions. Therefore, they are expected to appear more frequently than they would in these languages. Additionally, these sets are used in both the spoken, and in the written language. 
Due to their high usage frequency, these pronouns are also expected to go through some variations, as shown by the multiple attested forms, along with the new form /i/ studied by Villeneuve, Seigel, and Valdman, in their study of the spread of the Standard Haitian Creole in the North (2013).
Because the orthography is a near phonemic representation of the spoken language, If there are different forms of pronouns used in the spoken language, they should be attested in the written language as well. Additionally, if the morpho-phonology of the language influences its orthography, the forms of the pronouns found in the spoken language should be attested at similar frequency in the written language. Therefore, this study seeks to find whether these forms attested in the spoken language are attested at the same frequency in the written language.
Methodology 
In order to conduct this study, data from two corpora are analyzed. The first corpus is Indiana University�s corpus of spoken Haitian Creole, which was recorded in 2007 by Dr. Valdman. This corpus is made up of ten hour-long interviews which took place in rural and urban areas of Cap Haitien. They represent the speech of twenty participants covering a wide range of topics, from religion to education.  The corpus is made up of ten documents containing a total of 115 thousand words. This corpus will be used to provide variations within the speech patterns of the Cape Haitians. 
The second corpus used, Kokray, is a dynamic corpus of written text in Haitian Creole. It is made up of written documents mainly in the field of agriculture. This corpus is made up of ten different documents, containing about 100 thousand words, covering multiple different sectors within the agriculture field. This field is chosen as it is one of the most documented fields in the country, as well as the main job of most of the participants recorded.
From each of these corpora, a sample one hundred tokens were taken for each grammatical person. This excludes forms that are ambiguous in their syntactical usage, variants that were not used as pronouns. After a primary analysis of the data, it was found that y, /j/, is not only used as third person plural, it is also used as third person singular in many object placement. It is used as another shorten form for [li]. Since it has yet to be studied, it is also removed from the samples. 
From these samples, a comparative analysis is conducted between the usage of the long and short forms based on their syntactical usage. Based on the last phoneme, of the lexeme preceding these forms, as well as the first phoneme of the following lexeme, a phonological analysis is also conducted in each corpus. Additionally, a comparative analysis is conducted between the two corpora to see the differences between how these forms are used in the spoken language versus the written language.  
Chapter IV
Spoken corpus
As a point of departure, Figure 1 presents a macro level distribution of the pronouns across the syntactical positions. In the spoken corpus, more than 75 percent of the pronouns are used in the subject positions, both long and short forms. The rest are used as object, to show possessions, and emphasis respectively. 
 
Figure 1. Syntactical distribution of the pronouns in the spoken corpus
As can be seen in Figure 1, the pronouns are used across the syntactical positions. However, the preponderance of subject usage shows that the pronouns are mainly used in this syntactical position.  Additionally, though there is not much of a difference between the use of the short form versus the long form usage in Possession, and Subject positions, there is a remarkable preference of long forms in Emphatic position, and short forms in Object positions. 
The sample also show that not only there is a difference between the usages of long form versus short forms, there is also a difference in preference of these forms in the singular grammatical persons versus the plural grammatical persons. 
 
Table 2. Overall distribution
Table 2 shows that the first and the third grammatical persons have higher preference towards short forms. In addition to the short form l, the short form i is much preferred than the long form, li, and the known short form l. The data also shows that contrastively, the plural grammatical pronouns prefers long forms over the short forms. One of the main reasons for this usage could be to avoid ambiguity, especially in the case of y because it is also used as third grammatical person marker. 
The phonological analysis of the data in Figure 3 shows that a higher frequency of lexemes preceding the pronouns, long and short forms ends with vowels, while the lexemes following the pronouns more frequently start with consonants. 
 
Figure 3. Phonological distribution of lexemes ending with vowel/consonants (left side), and lexemes starting with vowel/consonants (right side)
Additionally, Figure 3 also shows that, though most of the preceding lexemes end with vowels, short forms prefer preceding lexemes ending with vowels more than the long forms. As shown on the left side of Figure 3, of fifty-four lexemes ending with consonants preceding the pronouns, less than forty percent precede the short forms. Contrastively, sixty percent of the preceding lexemes ending with vowels collocate with short forms of the pronouns. The lexemes following the pronouns that start with vowels also show higher preference in collocation with short forms. 
Written Corpus
Similarly to the spoken corpus, the pronouns are used across all the syntactical positions in the written corpus, and show a higher frequency in the Subject area. 
 
Figure 4. Syntactical distribution of the pronouns in the written corpus
Separated per syntactical positions, comparing short versus long form vowels, as shown in Figure 4 the written corpus show a preference towards long forms versus short forms for of the pronouns. Though in the Possession positions, the short form frequency is closer to that of the long forms than in the other positions, it is attested at much lower frequency. 
 
Table 5. Overall distribution
Table 5 confirms the preference of long forms versus shorts forms usage in the written corpus. Other than in first grammatical person, there is a clear difference between the usage of the short and the long forms of the pronouns. 
 
Figure 6. Phonological distribution of lexemes ending with vowel/consonants (left side), and lexemes starting with vowel/consonants (right side)
The phonological analysis, as shown by Figure 6, does not any phonological influence towards the preference of a particular for. Both consonants, and vowels of preceding lexemes prefer long forms. That may be because of the preponderance of long forms in the written corpus. Though more of the lexemes starting with vowels following the pronouns prefer short forms, there is not much of a difference. 
Conclusion
The data from the written corpus show that the pronouns are not used in the same manner as in the spoken language. Though in both corpora, the plural grammatical persons prefer the long forms, the written corpus overall prefer long forms more than the spoken corpus. Additionally, neither the short form i, nor the semi vowel y of the third grammatical person are attested in the written corpus.  
Though the spoken corpus shows a phonological influence on the choice of short forms versus long forms, as short forms tend to precede lexemes starting with vowels, these influences are not carried over to the written corpus. The written corpus shows an overall preference of long forms of pronouns over the short forms. Based on this analysis, the spoken language does not influence the written language. Though the pronouns are used in similar mannerism in both corpora, short forms of pronouns are used remarkably more frequently in the spoken language than in the written language. Additionally, there are other variants of the pronouns attested in the spoken language that are not attested in the written language. 


Discussion
Due to certain limitations, such as time to conduct the study, restriction in corpus size, and text type, the study could not embark a full sociolinguistic analysis of the usage of these forms. Therefore, a study of a larger amount of data, will bring more conclusive results on the morpho-phonological influence on the written language. Additionally, more studies of the language are necessary to distinguish when the short forms are used in the written language versus the long forms. The new variants  y, attested in the spoken corpora also needs to have more light shed on it. Maybe the low frequency attested as third grammatical person plural is to avoid ambiguity with its usage as third person singular.
