Introduction
In LVC, the rate of change within a community happens at a higher frequency phonologically, at a lower frequency morphologically, and at an even lower frequency syntactically. Though source of these changes maybe hard to pinpoint, collocational occurrences may provide corroboration to better understand how some of these changes come about. 
In this article, through the usage of collocation to determine constituency, Bybee & Scheibman argue that repetition condition may override the syntactic and semantic logic, and bring about new variables, may it be phonological, morphological, or morpho-phonological. �Elements that are frequently found next to each other show a tighter constituent structure that those that collocate less frequently� (Bybee & Scheibman, 1999:575). And �the more often two elements are used together, the more tightly they will be fused or bonded phonologically and semantically, and thus the tighter their constituency� (577). The frequent contact of the structures observed through the collocation of the elements, may lead to the formation of new variables with or without their own phonological aspect and semantic meaning. By analyzing the collocation of  don�t, the article provides an explanation to its collocational attestation, and its semantics meaning. 
Methodology
To analyzing the attestation of don�t in natural language, as well as in reading, a naturally occurring conversation of three hours and 45 minutes was recorded, and transcribed (579). This conversation, taking place in three distinct occasions, represents six participants from Albuquerque, New Mexico, of whom two were males.  Due to the difficulty to ascertain certain subtle phonetic differences within the participants� speech, the tokens of don�t found from this corpus are grouped into four categories (579). 
In Group 1, Bybee and Scheibman compile the don�t attested with a full-stop consonant, and a full vowel, such as [d�t], [d�n], and [d�]. The attestation with a reduced consonant with a full vowel [?�t], [?�], and [?~�] are sort in group 2. The tokens with both, vowel reduced to a shwa, and consonants reduced to a flap, [??~] and [?~?~], are sort in group 3, and group 4 contains the tokens with a reduced vowel, [?] (580). 
Through statistical collocational analysis of these tokens, Bybee and Scheibman studies the relation of the different morpho-phonological variation of don�t and their collocational environment. 
Results
The data corroborate the hypothesis that higher frequency of collocation would lead to higher variation. The data show that don�t exhibits a more reduced form in the environment in which it is most used. By using the different tokens with which don�t collocates the most, such as I, know, think, and want, in a descending order, the data show how much phonological change occurs with high collocational frequency, and as it decreases. 
In support of these hypothesis, Bybee & Scheibman argues that much like the pronouns, don�t �constitutes a storage and a processing unit,� which then, can go under phonological changes. Due to the high frequency of occurrences do and not, they gradually under reduction, and become a lexical unit.  This reduction, don�t, now due to its high frequency of occurrences with certain other collocates, continues to undergo this reduction process. 
Within 138 tokens, don�t collocates with I 88 times, making up 63% of the attested realization of don�t in the corpus. Being the highest frequency of occurrence, it is not surprising that it is with I that don�t shows the most reduction. Out of those 88 co-occurrences, 38 show the most reduction attested with the onset reduced to a flap, and the vowel to a shwa. 22 co-occurrences show a reduction to a flap and a vowel, and 16 show no reduction. For the rest of the co-occurrence where don�t is preceded by a lexical unit, show a large gap between the changes attested with I. You, being the next most frequent collocate is less than one third as frequent as I, 14 times. These 14 occurrences are equally divided between group 1 and group 2 where there were no full reduction as attested with the collocate I. The rest of the data show that the lower the collocational frequency, the lower the attestation of reduced forms of don�t. 
To further this analysis, Bybee and Scheibman study the collocates following the tokens. As expected, the three most frequent collocates are know, think, and have, where know constitute the second most frequent collocate of don�t after I. Affirming the results found with I, know show the most reduction with 24 out 39 occurrences are the reduced forms with a flap and a shwa. Reduction to flap and full vowel, and no reduction are attested in 8 and 2 occurrences respectively. The subsequent collocates think and have show 20 and 8 co-occurrences, respectively. Within those occurrences, 6 reductions to flap and shwa, with 6 reductions to flap and full vowel of don�t are attested with the collocate think, 1 flap and shwa, with 7 reductions to flap and full vowels are attested. In addition, the collocation of don�t with know also show a token in group 4, where only a reduced vowel [?] is attested. 
The data supports the argument of Bybee and Scheidman in that the collocation frequency has a direct influence on the first and second most frequent collocates I, and know, show the most amount of reduction, and the most reduced forms of don�t found in the data. 
Furthermore, Bybee and Scheidman also argues that in addition the high collocational frequency causing the morpho-phonological variations, it also create lexical units, and processing units that are stored �lexically and associated by lexical connections  with similar forms� (583). Based on this reasoning, the high frequency occurrences may form new variations within the processing units. For exemple, because I don�t know has such a high collocational frequency, they become a processing unit that is stored. Thus within this form, one may find multiple phonological variation, as shown in the data stated above. I don�t know shows the most reduced form of don�t with only a [?]. These processing units are used beyond their semantic meanings (which may be a cause of their high collocation frequency), and when used such situations they are more likely to appear as a variation. Because it does not require the semantic meaning of the lexical units, but rather a suggestive response, or a thought, the processing units stored is used. 
Discussion
From a syntactical point of view, because of the wider range of lexical items that follows the processing unit don�t,  versus the fewer number of lexical items that precede it, Bybee and Scheidman argue that auxiliary verbs are more attached to the subjects, rather than the verbs, contrarily to popular belief. This could be proven by the highest collocational frequency of I and don�t. Though I certainly collocates with a higher frequency with don�t, it may be that it is because I may be the most frequent token found in a spoken corpus, thus creates a bias in the outcome of the data. It is very much possible that this hypothesis holds true, however, more research in the arena is the need to prove the connection of subject verb interactions. Also, though I is the most frequent collocate, the most reduced for of don�t [?] is found in collocation with know, which is a verb. If there is a direct correlation between collocational frequency and lexical variation, should the data, therefore, show that the most reduced form [?] of don�t is attested with the most frequent collocate I?
High collocation frequency directly impacts lexical variation due to bond strengthening, and processing unit storage. The most frequent lexical unit found in human normal speech, based on the study of 6 participants from Albuquerque, high collocation frequency of I, don�t, and know lead to variation of reduced form of don�t� which may or may not hold its semantic meaning, depending on the environment. The data used certainly corroborate the argument, however, this area needs to be more researched in order to provide more data that can support the correlation between high collocation frequency and lexical variation as shown by Bybee and Scheidman.
