Introduction
Though collocation and semantic prosodies have seen much interest from linguists, there has been little work done in the cross linguistic field or in languages other than English. In addition to this, much less work has been done on the near synonyms in different languages or in contrast with different languages. Amongst the limited research covering semantic prosodies of near synonymy we find Sandinah�s (2000), and Tognini-Bonelli�s (2001) which compare English verses Portuguese and Italian. Similar to the work stated above, to further the research in semantic prosodies, and near synonymy, this paper seeks to compare English�s verses Standard Chinese�s semantic prosodies and near synonymy.    From a cross linguistic perspective, it explores the collocational behavior of the latter by studying near synonyms consequence, cause, and price/cost along with their equivalent in Standard Chinese. This paper seeks to answer the questions regarding Chinese exhibition of semantic prosodies and semantic preference comparable to English, and the implication of this contrastive analysis for language learners.   
	Xiao and Mcenery sought to conduct an unbias, through which they would minimize the role of the corpus itself, other than to provide the data needed. Consequently, to provide bases for the contrastive study, the corpora used included primarily FLOB, Frown, for English, and LCMC for Chinese. Additionally, they also used LOB, BROWN, People�s Daily, as well as BNC to provide supplementary data to provide basis for quantification. Through three case studies of near synonyms and their Chinese translation equivalents, the study compares the usage of semantic prosodies in their inclination to English. These three head word consequence, cause and cost/price, of which the groups of near synonyms are used, have seen much development in the study of their collocational behavior. 
Prior to using the Chinese equivalents of the English lexemes provided by translation dictionaries, Xiao and Mcenery confirmed their contextual relevance to the current project. The equivalents where the contextual semantics refer to a sense completely different, and could not be considered as part of a particular family of near synonyms of the lemma were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, given the large size of the corpora, each node of the near synonyms was set to have a minimum of at least three co-occurrences in order to avoid infrequent words. When using the additional data, a minimum of twenty co-occurrences was used in order to have a more 	concise set of node words. 
	To avoid ambiguity, near synonyms are �lexical pairs that have very similar cognitive or denotational mearnings, but may differ in collocational or prosodic behavior� (108). Though they may be synonyms, they do not appear in the same environment, nor behave the same manner; therefore, they are not interchangeable. In order to collocationally evaluate these groups of synonyms, each node would be categorized as either positive (a pleasant or favorable affective meaning), negative (a unpleasant or unfavorable affective meaning) and neutral (completely neutral, or context provides no evidence of positive nor negative) based on their collocates. 
	In order to test compare English and Chinese near synonymy�s collotional behavior through their semantic prosodies, these three groups of nodes for consequences, cause and price/cost were selected because they have been studied and have established patterns in the English language. This contrastive study will formulate whether similar semantic prosodies of near synonymy is attested in Chinese as in English, and how they are different. 
The consequence group
	From the consequence group of near synonyms, we find as a consequence, and in consequence (of) can be positive, neutral or negative, based on the contexts in which they are used. consequence and consequences tend to carry a negative semantic prosodies, and the plural consequences have a much stronger negative semantic prosodies. Consequence and consequences, along with consequently are used neutrally mainly in academic writing in concordance with as a result, or to show importance. consequence(s) when used positively shows patterns associated with �importance� and �result�. 
Along with their semantic prosodies, the positive consequence(s) , which means important, tend to collocate with have based on the corpus used.  Out of the 67 occurrences consequence(s) to mean importance, attested in the corpus, 54 follow have and carry a positive semantic prosodies. The rest are either positive or neutral. However, when consequence(s) carries the semantics of result it also carries negative semantic prosodies. Given a semantic spectrum of consequence(s) we find outcome/result, consequence, and aftermath, though have the same sense of consequence, carry semantic prosodies from positive to negative with aftermath show the most negative collocational behavior.
In the Chinese equivalents consequence, we find result/outcome, jie2guo3, does not express negative affective meanings. Its semantic prosodies depend on its contextual collocation. Of 240 attestations, it has 129 occurrences in neutral environments, then 33 and 78 in positive and negative collocational environment respectively. Though it may not be a significant difference, jie2guo3 carries a more neutral semantic prosody.  The equivalent of consequence/aftermath, hou4guo3 is typically negative, though due to lack of evidence of semantic prosody, it is attested neutrally. Out of 22 occurrences, 19 are attested in negative colloational environment. 
Though English and Chinese show some similarities, as in result/outcome and its equivalent, jie2guo3 are typically neutral and are dependent on their semantic prosodies, Chinese has more intensifiers which may determine whether these nodes are positive or negative. And similar to English, most of the neutral attestations of jie2guo3 were found in academic prose. 

The cause group
	Much as with consequence(s), multiple near synonyms of cause were studied based on their collocational behaviors. Of these near synonyms we find cause, arouse, lead to, result in/from, give rise to, and bring about respectively from the negative side to the positive side of the semantic prosody spectrum. Out of 264 occurrences, cause carries negative prosodies in 223 occurrences, and has 56 occurrences where it is used neutrally. 
	The equivalents of near synonyms of cause in Chinese show Zhi4shi3, niang4cheng2, and zao4cheng2 have more than 90% of their occurrences of 571, 94, and 208 respectively to have negative prosodies.   Zhi4shi3, shows not attestation of positive environment, while niang4cheng2 was not attested neutrally. On the other side of the semantic prosody spectrum, we find cu4cheng2 which is attested 98% positively and only 2% negatively out of 175 occurrences. 
The price/cost group
	The analysis of the collocational behavior of this group prove that it is used neutrally when used in its literal sense and negatively in metaphorical sense. Due to the low frequency of co-occurrences of the near synonyms of price/cost, to include their co-occurrences with (pre-post modifiers) at, pay, with, the literal usage of these terms are rare. Therefore, the data do not provide information that are statistically significant. With these modifiers, the literal sense of these terms typically are neutral, and refer to an amount of money. When used metaphorically, these terms �demonstrate a semantic preference for items indicating unpleasantness or enormous size� (122).
	In Chinese, the equivalent of price/cost, dia4jia4 is typically used metaphorically and denote a negative sense, and its literal form is replace by multiple near synonyms. Out of 32 co-occurrences attested in the corpus, four are neutral, as used in martial arts writing, and one to portray humor. The rest were negative. In the collocational study of dia4jia4, �pay� and �too big� are the most significant collocates, and both carry negative semantic prosodies as well. The modifiers correlating to dia4jia4 were all negative at rate of 98% from 423 instances. Some of the near synonyms used in the literal sense, jia4ge2, jia4qian2, jia4kuan3, and cheg2beng3 are only attested with positive or neutral semantic prosodies.  
	Through the contrastive study of collocational behavior and semantic prosody Xiao and Mcenery study English verse Chinese�s near synonyms behaviors from a cross linguistic point of view. The close translation equivalents of English terms to Chinese supports that both languages have features of semantic prosodies, and the data found corroborate hypothesis that near synonyms are not collocationally interchangeable. Close equivalents shows similar semantic prosodies, and the semantic prosodies of both languages chow a spectrum from negative to positive. The collocational behavior of the terms show in which context they would best be used, and where they would not, semantically. 
	The semantic prosodies and collocational behaviors are rather helpful in teaching students similarities in words. This become especially helpful in teaching second language learners, for it is very easily possible to mistakenly use the synonym of a words wrongly. Knowing the similarity in cross-linguistics collocation behaviors of near synonyms may help avoid this ambiguity. Though this is very useful, so far due to the lack of study in cross linguistic collocational behavior, these information is not available in all languages. Expanding the field to other languages will certainly help in learning multiple different other languages, and ovoid ambiguity.
