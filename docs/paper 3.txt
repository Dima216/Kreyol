Introduction
	This study presents the examinations and qualifications of the use of verbs as transitive or intransitive in certain contexts. In order to answer the question of when and why these two verbs, EAT and DRINK enter the diathesis alternations, this paper scrutinizes their transitivity � �as a lexico-syntactic phenomenon� (1) � across multiple corpora. In addition, this paper also summarizes the findings of a �large scale corpus inquiry on grammatical patterning� and �reintroduces a number of concerns about structures and content of lexical entries� (2). The discussion covers differences between written and spoken speech patterns, to include modalities, object and subject phrases, as well as results on transitivity claims. 
Methodology
	In order to answer the question stated in the introduction, Newman and Rice scrutinizes eat and drink across thousands of samples from the British National Corpus. From the BNC, two sub-corpora were taken, the sBNC, to represent the spoken corpus, and the wBNC, to represent the written corpus. These corpora were chosen due to their large amount of revealing illustrative examples which are far better than examples found in typical pedagogical grammar examples. These examples can also provide more insight into polyvalency of verbs. 
eat and drink are a closely related pairs, and share comparable degree of formality of usage within the same semantic domain, and in their usage with or without object �they are the verbs of transitivity par excellence� (2). Because they refer to common physiological experiences, they are �basic� verbs providing �natural candidates for sources of figurative and metaphorical extension and idiomatic usage� (2).  
The transitivity approached in this article is very conservative, in which �transitive� refers to a sentence in which the predicate is used with a direct object, and �intransitive� refers to such a construction where the verb is used without a direct object. Within the �intransitive� category, Newman and Rice use two subcategory, in which one designates an omitted, or unexpressed, but possible to understand, object, and the other refers to no object.  
In order to analyze eat and drink, the spoken corpus, in its entirety, was searched for all the different forms of these two lemmas. In the written corpus, on the other hand, Newman and Rice searched but only for a random sampling of 2000 tokens, for each lemma. In order to be more specific in the lexemes studied, and to avoid ambiguity, nominal forms, adjectives and verb forms terminating in �ing� were removed from the sample. Tokens tagged as uninterpretable were also used in the study for comparison purposes. \
In addition to the uninterpretable tag, Newman and Rice also tag the tokens as either transitive, intransitive, unspecified subject - for unexpressed, but understood subjects. 
Results
	One of the noticeable findings, prior to scrutinizing the tokens in the corpora chosen, was the usage of too many and all in the object of transitive phrases, as well as the preference of I and you as subjects in the spoken corpus. Based on the analysis of the diathesis alternations for eat and drink, the study supports the argument that these verbs behave differently in both, their argument structure, as well as the interpretation of their subject and object. In addition, the study demonstrated a direct correlation between the overt valency of these verbs and their tense, aspect, and mode. 
	Comparing the written and the spoken corpora showed a preponderance of the use of eat lemma, over drink. In addition, eat is used more often in both corpora than drink. The preference of using eat over drink is found to be highly significant, not only in frequency, but also in ordering. eat followed by drink  is attested at a significantly higher frequency than drink followed by eat. 
Transitivity 
In regards to their transitivity of both lemmas, they were used most of the time with objects. Both show greatest attestation of transitive usage in the spoken corpora. However, drink show more usage intransitively than does eat. 
In both, spoken and written corpora, eat shows greater intransitive usage with first plural, while contrarily, drink show greater transitive usage with first person subjects.  Both show greater usage of intransitive in third person plurals subjects. 
Individuation
	Based on Thompson and Hoper (2001:36), quantifying individuation is reached by determining the frequency of pronominal objects. Following this methodology, Newman and Rice produced a list of all the objects co-occurring with the lemmas eat and drink in a frequency list, ranking the top twenty most frequent objects. The analysis demonstrated that the pronoun it and them are the most frequent pronoun object in both corpora for the eat. These pronouns are attested more frequently in the spoken corpus than the written corpus. 
The differences in the pronoun frequency occurring with drink show an intriguing difference. The pronoun them does not appear in the top twenty co-occurring objects in neither the spoken, nor the written corpus. Similarly to eat, it is the most frequent co-occurring pronoun, in the spoken corpus for drink. On the written corpus, it is found in 5th ranking for eat, and 10th for drink. 
These results show that there is a higher individuation, based on the co-occurrences with these lemmas, in the spoken corpus than the written corpus. And in both corpora, eat shows a higher individuation with the highest ranking containing 375 occurrences of it, and 157 of the in the spoken and the written corpora respectively, while drink shows 104 of it and 79 of of respectively. 
Affectedness of O
By considering the type and frequency of �excessive� modifiers or quantifiers, Newman and Rice obtained trigrams from object phrases. These results were grouped similar to those of individuation. The trigrams show that there is a �propensity towards lexical items relating to an increased or excessive degree of consumption� for both lemmas: eat� and drink (20). In addition, many of these patterns show the transitive usage of these lemmas that are rarely acknowledge in the dictionaries. 
Preferred objects of consumption
Through the analysis of eat and drink, the most common nouns referring to food and drinks were also studied. The data reveals that the most frequent food nouns occurring in both spoken and written corpora is food. With drink, there is no noun occurring as frequent as food for eat.
Contrarily to dictionaries that show eat with the collocation of food to be a transitive sentence, these results show that these constructions may be either transitive, or intransitive. Lexicographical practices tend to omit the transitive usage of �eat a mean� and �drink alcohol.�
Subjects
In the interest of acquiring a better understanding of transitive and intransitive constructions as a whole, Newman and Rice also study the roles of subjects in these sentences. Based on the data for the lemmas eat and drink, animals were rarely attested as subject. Parallel patterns were attested in the results for eat and drink in their modalities, though in both corpora, higher frequency of subject collocates with eat, thank with drink.
Beyond (and below) the transitivity of eat and drink (Conclusion)
	In conclusion, a verb�s transitivity can vary based on collocations, aspects, and modal. Semantic properties of a verb is based on the sentence structures, however, argument structures are not hard wired. 
My discussion
	This article, to say it nicely, would not be print on my journal. Nevertheless, I am sure there are some great point that can be acquired from understanding this article. The research could certainly be better presented through a better flow, in which the importance would be explained rather than stated. It is highly possible that I have yet to develop my ability to understand extremely well written articles, however, I am not sure I found the answer to the question stated in the introduction. In addition to that, what are practical usage of such findings? Other than to state that drink is used more often than eat, however on a sequential manner, eat is followed by drink?
	Though some prior knowledge is expected when reading such an article, as it is field specific, some definitions, or prior mentioning of certain concepts maybe necessary before diverging into another topic, or point. For example, it would help to know, prior to introducing the comparison of this study to another article already written. This would therefore make this a comparative analysis of certain aspects of transitivity, or the other studies provided in the article. Some terminology may also need some clarification. Though it is clearly stated how to acquire the individuation, it is however not explained of what this individuation is, and what purpose does it play in the overall theses of transitivity, which is said to be the focus of the article. Additionally, what is �affectedness of O�? What is �O�? Though this article covers many sides of transitivity, it would have been a better paper if it was focused on one question that was answered.
